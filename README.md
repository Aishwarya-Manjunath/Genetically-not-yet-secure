# Genetically not yet Secure
This project was done as a part of the Computer network Security course.</n>
We have explored how Psuedo random Numbers can be easily predicted, and how we can increase the randomness of these numbers can be increased by applying concepts from the Genetic algorithm such as crossover and mutation. We have also looked into how crossover and mutation can also be applied for Symmetric Encryption and some attacks which can be done on the same.</n></n>
<b>Cracking Javas Random Library</b> </n>
This includes how, given two numbers from Javas Random library it is easy to predict the following numbers.
